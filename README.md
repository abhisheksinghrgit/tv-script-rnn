# tv-script-rnn

The repo contains jupyter notebook for generating tv script using LSTM and RNN.
Framework used is Google's Tensorflow for machine learning.
The program is divided into usable modules such as to get data, clean , transform and various modules to tweak changes as per the need.
The output is not good as it should be (because I don't have resources(GPU and all), enough data and I still need to learn more to get the insight) 
I haven't uploaded the data as it is such to big file incase you need the data or you want to talk about the code contact me on twitter or linkedin twitter.com/SinghNaruto www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheksinghrgit
